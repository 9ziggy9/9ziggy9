### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub.
My name is David and I'm a junior web development instructor. As a college dropout, I guess I never got tired of math and physics related things, I've continued to learn independently and am currently re-reading Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis. I love the mathematical aspects of computing, especially physics simulations involving approximations to continuous phenomenon.

My real passion in computing is computer architecture and low-level concepts although my knowledge is sub-mediocre at best. I'm a C programmer at heart.

No offense, but if I'm not allowed to use emacs, I'm not interested.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a chip-8 emulator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Haskell, x86 assembler
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any low-level game ideas
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with whatever tf a monad is
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mathematics of simulations
- âš¡ Fun fact: I dropped out of college but my math/physics knowledge is probably postgraduate level.
