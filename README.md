### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub.
My name is David and I'm a junior web development instructor. As a college dropout, I guess I never got tired of math and physics related things, I've continued to learn independently and am currently re-reading Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis. I love the mathematical aspects of computing, especially physics simulations involving approximations to continuous phenomenon.

My real passion in computing is computer architecture and low-level concepts although my knowledge is sub-mediocre at best. I'm a C programmer at heart.

No offense, but if it can't be done with emacs it ought not be done.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a chip-8 emulator
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell, x86 assembler
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any low-level game ideas
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with whatever tf a monad is
- 💬 Ask me about mathematics of simulations
- ⚡ Fun fact: install gentoo
